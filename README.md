# Credit_Risk_Analysis

This project is to predict credit risk using Machine Learning which help to predict and provide more reliable loan experience for the customers. Machine Leaning techniques is believed give more acurate identification of good candiates for laon which will lower the defailt rate.

## Analysis Overview 

Used Python and machine Leaning techniques such as resampling and Boasting using libraries like imbalanced-learn & Scikit-Learn,  to make the most of the model and data. 

* Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
* Undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm
* Then used combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
* Compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.
* Evaluate the performance of these models to give recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
